Follow TDD approach to solve the below problem

Class `FizzBuzz` should have a method which will take a number as input and return a String based on the below condition

- Should return `fizz` if the number is divisible by 3.
- Should return `buzz` if the number is divisible by 5.
- Should return `fizzbuzz` if the number is divisible by 15.
- Should return the same number if no requirement is fulfilled.
- Should throw `IllegalArgumentException` if the number is less than or equal to 0.

Make sure to write test case first for the above scenario before writing the actual code
